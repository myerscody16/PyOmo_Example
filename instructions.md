PyOmo Demo: Competitive Retail Store Location Optimization
This document provides a comprehensive guide to building a competitive retail store location model using the PyOmo library. The objective is to determine the optimal locations for new stores to maximize market share in a competitive landscape. The code can be run in a Python environment like a Jupyter Notebook or directly from a script.

üìù Problem Overview
We are tasked with a common but complex business problem: where should we open new retail stores to attract the most customers? This isn't just about finding empty lots; it's about understanding the competitive environment. Our decision must account for:

Existing Stores: Both our own and those of our competitors.

Customer Demand: Concentrated in various geographic locations.

Customer Choice: How customers decide which store to visit, or if they'll shop at all.

To model this, we'll use a market share-based facility location model. Specifically, we'll implement a version of the Huff model, a popular method in marketing and urban planning. This model predicts the probability that a customer will choose a particular store based on its attractiveness (which we'll simplify to be its proximity) relative to all other available options, including the option of not visiting any store (the "no-choice" option).

The goal is to select a limited number of new store locations from a set of potential sites to maximize our total captured market share.

‚öôÔ∏è Setup and Dependencies
While PyOmo is already installed, you will need pandas for data handling. You will also need an optimization solver. We will use GLPK (GNU Linear Programming Kit), which is a powerful, open-source solver.

Installing Pandas
If you don't have pandas installed, open your terminal or command prompt and run:

Bash

pip install pandas
Installing the GLPK Solver
On Linux (Debian/Ubuntu):

Bash

sudo apt-get install glpk-utils
On macOS (using Homebrew):

Bash

brew install glpk
On Windows:
Installation on Windows can be more complex. A good option is to install it via conda if you are using an Anaconda distribution:

Bash

conda install -c conda-forge glpk
Alternatively, you can find installers on the winglpk SourceForge page.

üìä Data Loading and Preparation
First, we'll load the data from the provided CSV files into our Python script using the pandas library. Make sure all the .csv files are in the same directory as your script or notebook.

Python

import pandas as pd
import pyomo.environ as pyo
import math # Import math for the exponential function

# --- Load the Sets ---
# These define the different entities in our model.
try:
    set_I = pd.read_csv('RetailStores.xlsx - Set I.csv', header=None, skiprows=1)[0].tolist()
    set_J = pd.read_csv('RetailStores.xlsx - Set J.csv', header=None, skiprows=1)[0].tolist()
    set_M = pd.read_csv('RetailStores.xlsx - Set M.csv', header=None, skiprows=1)[0].tolist()
    set_S = pd.read_csv('RetailStores.xlsx - Set S.csv', header=None, skiprows=1)[0].tolist()

    # --- Load the Parameters ---
    # These are the data values for our model.
    # We read them into dictionaries for easy lookup in PyOmo.
    h_is = pd.read_csv('RetailStores.xlsx - h_is.csv', header=None, skiprows=1, names=['i', 's', 'value']).set_index(['i', 's'])['value'].to_dict()
    d_ij = pd.read_csv('RetailStores.xlsx - d_ij.csv', header=None, skiprows=1, names=['i', 'j', 'value']).set_index(['i', 'j'])['value'].to_dict()
    v_j0 = pd.read_csv('RetailStores.xlsx - V_j=0.csv', header=None, skiprows=1, names=['i', 'value']).set_index('i')['value'].to_dict()

    print("Data loaded successfully!")

    # --- Create Subsets for Easier Modeling ---
    # We categorize all store locations (Set M) into three groups:
    # E: Our Existing stores
    # C: Competitor stores
    # P: Potential new locations (this should match Set J)
    set_E = [j for j in set_M if str(j).startswith('E')]
    set_C = [j for j in set_M if str(j).startswith('C')]
    set_P = [j for j in set_M if str(j).startswith('P')]

except FileNotFoundError as e:
    print(f"Error loading files: {e}")
    print("Please ensure all required CSV files are in the same directory.")

üß† The Optimization Model
Here is the mathematical formulation of our problem.

Sets
I: Set of demand locations (e.g., neighborhoods).

J: Set of potential locations for new stores.

E: Set of our existing store locations.

C: Set of competitor store locations.

S: Set of customer segments.

Parameters
h_is: Total demand of customer segment s in demand location i.

d_ij: Distance (or travel time) between demand location i and store location j.

v_i,j=0: The baseline utility of the "no-choice" option for a customer at location i.

P_max: The maximum number of new stores we can open (our budget).

Decision Variables
x_j: A binary variable for each potential location j
inJ.

x_j=1 if we decide to open a store at location j.

x_j=0 otherwise.

Objective Function
Our goal is to maximize the total captured demand. The captured demand from each location i and segment s is the total demand (h_is) multiplied by the probability that a customer chooses one of our stores.

The utility of a store j for a customer at location i is modeled as the inverse of the distance: U_ij=1/d_ij.

The probability that a customer at location i chooses one of our stores (existing or new) is given by the ratio of the utility of our stores to the total utility of all options:

üíª PyOmo Implementation
Now, we translate the mathematical model into PyOmo code.

Python

# Create a concrete PyOmo model instance
model = pyo.ConcreteModel(name="Retail_Store_Location")

# --- SETS ---
model.I = pyo.Set(initialize=set_I)
model.J = pyo.Set(initialize=set_J)
model.S = pyo.Set(initialize=set_S)
model.E = pyo.Set(initialize=set_E)
model.C = pyo.Set(initialize=set_C)
model.P = pyo.Set(initialize=set_P) # Potential locations

# --- PARAMETERS ---
model.h = pyo.Param(model.I, model.S, initialize=h_is, default=0)
model.d = pyo.Param(model.I, model.P | model.E | model.C, initialize=d_ij, default=1e6) # Use a large default for missing distances
model.v0 = pyo.Param(model.I, initialize=v_j0, default=0)
model.P_max = pyo.Param(initialize=5, doc="Maximum number of new stores to open")

# --- VARIABLES ---
# Our decision: which of the potential locations to build a store in.
model.x = pyo.Var(model.P, within=pyo.Binary)

# --- OBJECTIVE FUNCTION ---
# This function calculates the total captured market share.
def objective_rule(model):
    total_market_share = 0
    for i in model.I:
        # Denominator: Total utility from all stores + no-choice option
        # This part is nonlinear because of the decision variable x[j] in the denominator.
        denominator = (
            sum(1/model.d[i,j] for j in model.E) +
            sum(1/model.d[i,j] for j in model.C) +
            sum(1/model.d[i,j] * model.x[j] for j in model.P) +
            math.exp(model.v0[i])
        )
        
        # To avoid division by zero if all distances are somehow infinite
        if denominator == 0:
            continue

        # Numerator: Utility from our stores (existing + new)
        our_stores_utility = (
            sum(1/model.d[i,j] for j in model.E) +
            sum(1/model.d[i,j] * model.x[j] for j in model.P)
        )
        
        # Total demand from this location across all segments
        total_demand_at_i = sum(model.h[i,s] for s in model.S)
        
        total_market_share += total_demand_at_i * (our_stores_utility / denominator)
        
    return total_market_share

model.objective = pyo.Objective(rule=objective_rule, sense=pyo.maximize)

# --- CONSTRAINTS ---
# This rule enforces the budget limit on new stores.
def budget_constraint_rule(model):
    return sum(model.x[j] for j in model.P) <= model.P_max

model.budget_constraint = pyo.Constraint(rule=budget_constraint_rule)

print("PyOmo model has been built successfully.")
üöÄ Solving the Model and Analyzing Results
With the model built, the final step is to solve it and interpret the output. This problem is a Nonlinear Integer Program (NLIP), which can be very challenging to solve. We need a solver capable of handling such problems. For this demo, we'll try a solver like scip which is available through anaconda or bonmin/couenne if available. If those are not available, you might need to install them.

Note: If you don't have a nonlinear solver, you won't be able to solve this specific formulation. glpk can only handle linear problems. A good open-source nonlinear solver is Ipopt, often used with a branch-and-bound algorithm for integer variables.

Python

# --- SOLVE ---
# For nonlinear integer problems, you need a capable solver.
# 'scip', 'bonmin', or 'couenne' are good open-source options.
# You might need to specify the path to the solver executable.
try:
    # We will attempt to use the 'scip' solver
    solver = pyo.SolverFactory('scip', executable='/usr/bin/scip') # Adjust path if necessary
    results = solver.solve(model, tee=True) # tee=True shows solver output

    # --- RESULTS ---
    print("\n" + "="*30)
    print("      OPTIMIZATION RESULTS")
    print("="*30 + "\n")

    if (results.solver.status == pyo.SolverStatus.ok) and (results.solver.termination_condition == pyo.TerminationCondition.optimal):
        print("Solver Status: Optimal Solution Found ‚ú®")
        
        print(f"\nMaximum Captured Market Share: {pyo.value(model.objective):,.2f}")

        print("\nOptimal Locations for New Stores:")
        opened_stores = [j for j in model.P if pyo.value(model.x[j]) > 0.5]
        if opened_stores:
            for store in opened_stores:
                print(f"- {store}")
        else:
            print("No new stores were opened.")
            
    elif results.solver.termination_condition == pyo.TerminationCondition.infeasible:
        print("Solver Status: Infeasible üòî")
    else:
        print(f"Solver Status: {results.solver.status}")

except Exception as e:
    print(f"\nAn error occurred during solving: {e}")
    print("Please ensure you have a nonlinear integer programming solver like 'scip', 'bonmin', or 'couenne' installed and in your system's PATH.")
